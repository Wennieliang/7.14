      With the rapid development of science, we can receive various information in each moment. Some people believe that the information is reliable and it can help us to work easily. While others hold that the information is trustless. Myself, I agree with the latter one because there are an increasing number of information trap behind which can lead us to lose money or personal date.

      We can’t live without information, which can benefit us with homework, survey and daily life. For example, we are given paper work by teacher and asked for collect our country’s history development or when we move to a new place and want to buy commodity consumption , but we don’t know the way to supermarket. Finally we accomplish those jobs perfectely. So at this moment the information is reliable.

      Otherwise, we can also get fake information behind us. A job is one of the most decisive things in our life. However, we might get some troubles because of those things. For instance, when we are surfing the internet, we frequently face some invite ad and most of them just want to cheat our money instead of really want to invite us. Therefore this information is unreliable.

      In conclusion, information is a double-edged sword. Although it have both upsides and downsides , it all depends on us. So let’s looking forward to the health process of information.
