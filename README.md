      With the development of science, we receive  information in every seconds. Some people believe that the information is reliabled and it  helps people to work easily. While others hold that the information is trustless, because information contain false message. I agree with the second opinion,  because there are an increasing information trap, which leads people to lose money or personal information.

      People cannot live in a society without information because infomation benefits people with their homework, and survey. For example, we are given paper work by teacher and was asked for collect our country’s history development data in a year or when we move to a new place and want to buy commodity consumption , but we donnot know the way to a supermarket. In those situation, the information is real, and helps people to find a way to their destination.

      People get fake information around them. A job is one of the most decisive things in our life. However, we might get some troubles because of those things. For instance, when we are surfing the internet, we received invited advitised on the screen and most of advitised is used to cheat their money instead of really want to invite people. In this situation, the information is unreliable, because it did not have the function as the advertised stated.
    Information is a double-edged sword. It contains pros and cons , and it all depends on people how to use it. let’s looking forward to the healthy process of information and make good use of it.
